# Deep_Learning

In this repository, we have three different projects. Chronologically you should go through File 1 and then file 2
In file 1, I train a Resnet using Imagenet data
In file 2, I use the NN from file 1 to create an algorithm designed to annotate images by accepting an image, creating a list of suggested bounding boxes, and using the neural network to identify which proposed bounding boxes it has a high classification probability.
In file 3, I reproduce calculations from the paper, "Exponential expressivity in deep neural networks through transient chaos" which explores the expressivity of deep neural networks as depth increases.

If you have any questions please email me at

Enjoy!
